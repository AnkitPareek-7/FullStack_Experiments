Practice 1 - Capstone Project

Title
Todo Application with Basic CRUD Operations

Objective
Learn how to design and build a simple full stack application that performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. Understand the basic flow of storing, retrieving, and managing data in a database.

Task Description
Build a todo application (e.g., using React for the frontend and Node.js/Express + MongoDB or any database for the backend). Implement functionality to:

Add new todo items
Display the list of existing todos
Update todo items (e.g., mark as completed)
Delete items from the list
Use simple styling to make the UI clear and user-friendly. Test your application by adding, editing, and removing todos, and ensure data updates correctly in the database.

Expected Output
A working web app where users can manage their todo items.
Fully functional CRUD backend connected to a database.
Clear, user-friendly interface to view and interact with todos.


Practice 2 - Capstone Project

Title
Blog Platform with Comments and User Profiles

Objective
Develop a more advanced application that manages dynamic user-generated content. Understand user authentication, relationships between users and posts, and data modeling for comments.

Task Description
Create a full stack blog platform:

Users can sign up and create profiles.
Users can write blog posts, edit, and delete them.
Other users can view posts and add comments.
Store user data, posts, and comments in your database. Build a clean frontend (React or similar) and a backend API to handle authentication (e.g., JWT), CRUD operations, and relational data. Test your app by creating different users, writing posts, and adding comments.

Expected Output
Multi-user blogging platform with real-time comment updates.
User authentication system with protected routes.
Well-structured database that links users, posts, and comments.


Practice 3 - Capstone Project

Title
Social Media App with Posts, Authentication, and AWS Deployment

Objective
Build a complex real-world project that combines frontend, backend, user authentication, and cloud deployment. Learn how to make scalable apps, deploy them, and handle real user interactions.

Task Description
Develop a small social media application where users can:

Register and log in securely.
Create, edit, and delete posts (with optional images).
View posts from other users in a feed.
Like and comment on posts.
Build the frontend with React (or Next.js) and backend with Node.js/Express or similar. Use JWT or OAuth for authentication. Store data in a cloud database (e.g., Amazon RDS or DynamoDB). Deploy the application on AWS (using EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, or ECS) and configure a domain, HTTPS, and load balancing if possible.

Expected Output
Fully deployed social media app accessible online.
Secure user authentication and interactive features.
Scalable architecture hosted in the cloud (AWS).
